About
=====

A distributed system for computing and exporting beam integrals of all 6
supported beam types, as defined in the `beam_integrals project`_ and
[Milasinovic1997]_.

This work is a part of the investigation within the research projects:
[ON174027]_ and [TR36017]_, supported by the Ministry for Science and
Technology, Republic of Serbia. This support is gratefully acknowledged.

Installation
============

export_beam_integrals doesn't require system wide installation, just clone this
repository to get started.


Quick start (distributed system in a box)
=========================================

Make any changes you'd like to ``Vagrantfile`` and ``docker-compose.yml``,
and please note that environment variables are used to configure the distributed
system. See ``Dockerfile.server`` and ``Dockerfile.worker`` for more details.

Run the following command will automatically provision a new virtual machine;
which will then build, configure and start the entire distributed system::

    $ vagrant up


Production use
==============

export_beam_integrals has been thoroughly tested and is production ready, either
by using standard Docker tools or specialized automated clustering systems. See
``Dockerfile.server`` and ``Dockerfile.worker`` for more details.
